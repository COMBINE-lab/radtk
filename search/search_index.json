It consists of a number of different sub-commands.  The current sub-commands are listed below:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>cat</code> : Concatenates a series of input RAD files into an output RAD file.  The input files must have compatible headers (i.e. be built on the same referece, and contain the   same tag set).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>view</code> : Output a RAD file into a textual (currently JSON) format.  This can be useful for inspecting the contents of a RAD file or specifically examining or searching for some record   or quantity of interest. It optionally employs many filters to help discard alignments that may reduce quantification accuracy.  Currently, the set of filters applied in <code>oarfish</code> are directly derived from the <code>NanoCount</code>[^Gleeson] tool; both the filters that exist, and the way their values are set (with the exception of the <code>--three-prime-clip</code> filter, which is not set by default in <code>oarfish</code> but is in <code>NanoCount</code>).</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
