It consists of a number of different sub-commands.  The current sub-commands are listed below:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>cat</code> : Concatenates a series of input RAD files into an output RAD file.  The input files must have compatible headers (i.e. be built on the same referece, and contain the   same tag set).</p> </li> <li> <p><code>split</code> : The inverse operation of <code>cat</code>. The split operation takes a single RAD file as input and a target number of records, and the splits the input RAD file into several separate smaller RAD files, each with approximately the target number of records.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>view</code> : Output a RAD file into a textual (currently JSON) format.  This can be useful for inspecting the contents of a RAD file or specifically examining or searching for some record   or quantity of interest.</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
